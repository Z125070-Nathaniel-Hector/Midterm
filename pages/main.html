            <p>My name is Nathaniel Hector, and I am an artist and programmer. I have loved video games 
                since I was a child; now I'm working on making my own. I also love powerful narratives 
                and environmental horror; the more the person experiencing art is involved in it, the better.</p>

            <p>Drawing. I have a long history of creating art in various mediums. I am currently studying digital art.</p>
            <p>Programming. I have a background in software development and cybersecurity. Even where I fall short, I am looking to learn and improve at every opportunity.</p>
            <p>Writing. I have been writing stories for games for a few years. I am currently focusing on a single, long-term project that follows two intertwined stories.</p>
